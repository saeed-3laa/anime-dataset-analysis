# anime-dataset-analysis
This project analyzes a dataset of 1,000 anime entries. It involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns, followed by data preprocessing to clean the dataset. Using Python libraries, we visualize insights related to anime scores, popularity, genres, and member counts, enhancing our understanding of the anime landscape.
